It also permits the user to play with the data and make the information more understandable. In addition, interactive data manipulation enables to study the behaviour of a mathematical model, as the parameters of the model are being modified which can be helpful for example in developing interactive education materials.It is even used by newspapers like the New York Times and scientific papers like Science.</p> <p>R shiny is an excellent framework to turn an R analysis into an interactive web application and we will be presenting a two-hour introductory workshop to build interactive apps with R Shiny.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will cover the structure of R Shiny Apps, and the concept of reactivity, where an 'event' such as changing the value of the input or selecting a row in a table, triggers a set of reactions and results in updating the output value. We will also briefly talk about ways to publish and distribute an app publicly.</p> <p>A little about Marie and Soroor:</p> <p>Marie graduated from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse in France in the major of engineering and mathematics, and got her PhD degree on System Biology and Structural Biology Modeling from the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. Marie has joined Terry Speed lab’s as a Postdoctoral research fellow about a year ago, in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.</p> <p>Soroor is a Research Assistant in Davis laboratory, also in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. She joined Davis laboratory in 2014 as a UROP student, and was promoted to a RA in 2016. She is currently doing a part-time masters degree in Statistics at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>This will be a fantastic workshop and we can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be provided!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ","public",10800000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472776317000,"R-Ladies Melbourne",20378903,"open",-37.810001373291,144.960006713867,"R-Ladies-Melbourne","Members","Melbourne, Australia","en_US"
