For our first event of 2018 Belinda Maher will be joining us to tell us about her work with geospatial data and R.</p> <p>Belinda started her journey in transport data at KiwiRail, where she worked on a $2 billion (NZD) upgrade of Auckland's suburban train network. After returning home to Melbourne, she took up a role at Public Transport Victoria in Operational Performance Analysis.<br/>At PTV Belinda used R to plot the location of stations, stops and timing points and the paths of public transport routes. She created dashboards containing spatial visualisations of Victorian public transport operational performance data.<br/>Belinda now works at Swinburne University, using in R and Tableau on data which is (unfortunately) not about trains. Belinda holds a Bachelor of Science from The University of Melbourne and a Graduate Diploma in Statistics and Operations Research from RMIT.</p> <p>Talk Title:<br/>Public Transport Maps and Geospatial Data in R using PTV GTFS data</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an open standard for publishing public transport schedules and associated geographic location and transport service path information.Public Transport Victoria (PTV) first published a GTFS version of their timetable data in 2015, which enabled Google to begin showing ‘public transit’ options for directions in Victoria within Google maps. This data is publicly available on the PTV website. This talk will cover working with GTFS spatial data to plot maps in R, using the leaflet and sp packages. Belinda will explain how to create zoomable maps of transport paths and stations, and mention some of the challenges of working with this dataset.</p> <p>This meetup is hosted by our wonderful sponsor Zendesk, who will be provided pizza and drinks for us for the evening!</p> <p>We can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ",public,,24579586,Zendesk Basement,-37.8170280456543,144.96153259277344,FALSE,"395 Collins St, Melbourne",Melbourne,au,Australia,,,1472776317e3,R-Ladies Melbourne,20378903,open,-37.810001373291016,144.9600067138672,R-Ladies-Melbourne,Members,"Melbourne, Australia",en_US,,The Zendesk basement can be accessed from Queen Street,,,,,,,,,,

She will now be coming to give us an update on her journey:)</p> <p><br/>Daniela is a Data Scientist at Idatha, a software company in<br/>Montevideo, Uruguay. Prior to Idatha, she worked at Equifax where she<br/>discovered Data Science and fell in love with it. She loves blogging<br/>and she does it both in English and Spanish, sharing whatever she is<br/>playing with at the moment (data visualization, tidytext, social media<br/>data, etc.) She is a member of the NASA Datanauts community and<br/>co-founder of two R-Ladies chapters: Buenos Aires and Montevideo.</p> <p>

While there are many incredible courses and resources, nothing is as effective as finding an intriguing question and challenging oneself to create an original visual answer. Generating visualizations can be astonishingly satisfying and can drive deep dives into R workflow, libraries, and community resources. I will present snippets of scripts and notebooks written to visually answer the following questions, running the gamut from quirky and light to serious and weighty: How often do female athletes grace the cover of Sports Illustrated? How have demographics changed in the sciences? How have Pixar movie ratings changed over time? How did US Senators vote on healthcare repeal? Which characters are closest on the TV show ‘Friends’?</p> <p>Presenter Bio:<br/>Alex Albright is a PhD student in economics at Harvard University. An aspiring labor and behavioral economist, Alex is passionate about making empirical academic work reproducible and accessible. Her usage of R stems from a desire to use tools that are freely available and open source.

If you are interested in R, whether a beginner or an expert, then put this in your diary!</p> <p>Doors open at 6pm<br/>Talk will commence at 6:30pm</p> <p># Speaker<br/>Karthik Ram is a Data Scientist at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and Berkeley Institute for Global Change Biology. He is a co-founder of rOpenSci, a collective to support the development of R-based tools which facilitate open science and access to open data.</p> <p># Full Title<br/>Reproducible data science with R: Lessons and highlights from the rOpenSci project</p> <p># Summary<br/>The Open Science movement, which promotes sharing all artifacts of scientific research such as data, code, and methods, is becoming increasingly popular among researchers worldwide. This rapid increase in popularity is evidenced in the thriving ecosystem of tools and also numerous training initiatives that have sprung up at various institutions.</p> <p>One such effort in this space is the rOpenSci project (<a href=""https://ropensci.org"" class=""linkified"">https://ropensci.org</a>). Founded as a grassroots effort six years ago, the project works to promote open and reproducible research by enabling discovery of data, code and software, creating the technical and social infrastructure to enable reproducible research, and advocate for a culture of open science in various disciplines. This community driven project builds upon R’s popularity as a scientific research tool and fills in additional gaps in the computational pipeline by providing tools for data acquisition (from APIs and other source), data manipulation (including an emerging suite for spatial data analysis and mapping), data visualization tools, and data publication tools. Beyond tooling, the project has been working towards promoting best practices in scientific computing (beyond the R language itself) by developing a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software, mentorship, and community development.</p> <p>In this talk I’ll speak about the history and motivations behind the project, demo some of our recent tools that can streamline your data science workflow, and also talk about our efforts to build community through various initiatives.</p> <p>More details to follow.</p> ",public,,,,,,,,,,,,,151119739e4,R-Ladies Auckland,26653882,open,-36.849998474121094,174.75999450683594,rladies-auckland,Members,"Auckland, New Zealand",en_US,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p># Important to know</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Start: 7:00pm<br/>**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008</a></p> ",public,,,,,,,,,,,,,1454258193e3,R-Ladies London,19474893,approval,51.52000045776367,-0.10000000149011612,rladies-london,R-Ladies,"London, United Kingdom",en_US,,,,,,,,,,,,
