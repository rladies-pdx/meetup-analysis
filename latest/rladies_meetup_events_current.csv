While there are many incredible courses and resources, nothing is as effective as finding an intriguing question and challenging oneself to create an original visual answer. Generating visualizations can be astonishingly satisfying and can drive deep dives into R workflow, libraries, and community resources. I will present snippets of scripts and notebooks written to visually answer the following questions, running the gamut from quirky and light to serious and weighty: How often do female athletes grace the cover of Sports Illustrated? How have demographics changed in the sciences? How have Pixar movie ratings changed over time? How did US Senators vote on healthcare repeal?
