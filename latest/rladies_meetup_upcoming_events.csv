This rapid increase in popularity is evidenced in the thriving ecosystem of tools and also numerous training initiatives that have sprung up at various institutions.</p> <p>One such effort in this space is the rOpenSci project (<a href=""https://ropensci.org"" class=""linkified"">https://ropensci.org</a>). Founded as a grassroots effort six years ago, the project works to promote open and reproducible research by enabling discovery of data, code and software, creating the technical and social infrastructure to enable reproducible research, and advocate for a culture of open science in various disciplines. This community driven project builds upon R’s popularity as a scientific research tool and fills in additional gaps in the computational pipeline by providing tools for data acquisition (from APIs and other source), data manipulation (including an emerging suite for spatial data analysis and mapping), data visualization tools, and data publication tools. Beyond tooling, the project has been working towards promoting best practices in scientific computing (beyond the R language itself) by developing a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software, mentorship, and community development.</p> <p>In this talk I’ll speak about the history and motivations behind the project, demo some of our recent tools that can streamline your data science workflow, and also talk about our efforts to build community through various initiatives.</p> <p>More details to follow.</p> ",public,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,151119739e4,R-Ladies Auckland,26653882,open,-36.849998474121094,174.75999450683594,rladies-auckland,Members,"Auckland, New Zealand",en_US,,,,,,

I do not think, that we are supposed to choose one and live with that for the rest of our lives. So how can we decide which one to use for what purpose?.</p> <p>In this session, we will talk about the first steps of R and Python, for what tasks can these languages be used in the best way, and how. You will be able to try both languages during the session in different environments. We will build some interesting stuff from basic statistical models to some hardcore deep learning algorithms.</p> <p>5:45 - 5:55 --- Break.</p> <p>5:55 - 6:40 --- Second lighting talk: 'Cluster analysis for customer segmentation' by Joselene Marques, Data Scientist @ Justt.</p> <p>You will get a short introduction to customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value) and a quick start to perform cluster analysis in R.<br/>We start by presenting required R packages for data manipulation, cluster analysis and visualization.<br/>Next, we describe two clustering techniques k-MEANS and SOM (self-organizing map).<br/>Finally, we present the result with lots of insightful (and easy to code) plots.</p> <p>6:40 - 7:00 --- Networking.</p> <p>Don't forget to bring your laptops if you want to experiment a little.</p> <p>RSVP, a.s.a.p. as we only have 30 places available!

She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p># Important to know</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Start: 7:00pm<br/>**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008</a></p> ",public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1454258193e3,R-Ladies London,19474893,approval,51.52000045776367,-0.10000000149011612,rladies-london,R-Ladies,"London, United Kingdom",en_US,,,,,,
